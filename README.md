# Designing and Analyzing the Results of an A/B Test:  Changing Udacity's Course Sign-Up

* Selected metrics to evaluate the proposed change
* Characterized the variability of those metrics
* Determined the sample size necessary to obtain a statistically significant result
* Assessed risk to specify an appropriate experiment duration and percent of traffic to divert
* Performed sanity checks on the invariant metrics to determine if the experiment was run and sized properly
* Gauged the effects using confidence intervals and sign tests
* Recommended whether or not to launch the change
* Suggested a follow-up experiment
